# Tutorial
**For this tutorial, I will be walking you through how to set up a simple repository on your machine, making changes to your directory, rolling back to a previous version, and more. This guide is an ongoing process and will be continously updated**

## Step 1
If you have not already installed Git on your machine, do that
- you can find it [here](https://git-scm.com/)
- depending on your OS the installation may differ, just go with the defaults for now.
- After you have installed Git on your machine, type the following command into the terminal
```
    git --version
```
- If you get an error, git was not installed properly. Try again and verify with the terminal.
